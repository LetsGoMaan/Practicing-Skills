// Hello World!

Use the var keyword to create a variable called myName

var myName; */

/* 3.
Assign the value 7 to variable a

var a;
a = 7; */

/* 4.
Assign the contents of a to variable b

var a;
a = 7;

/* 5.
Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9

Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.

var myFirstName = "Andrey";

Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined

Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.

/* 9.
Update the code so it only uses the let keyword.

/* 10.
Change the code so that all variables are declared using let or const. Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant. Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices. Do not change the strings assigned to the variables.

const FCC = "freeCodeCamp";
let fact = "is cool!"; 
fact = "is awesome!";
console.log(FCC, fact); */

/* 11.
Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20.

/* 12.
Change the 0 so the difference is 12.

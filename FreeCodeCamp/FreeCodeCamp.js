// Hello World!

Use the var keyword to create a variable called myName

Assign the value 7 to variable a

var a;
a = 7; */

Assign the contents of a to variable b

var a;
a = 7;

Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9

Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.

var myFirstName = "Andrey";

Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined

Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.

/* 9.
Update the code so it only uses the let keyword.

let catName = "Oliver";
let catSound = "Meow!"; */

/* 10.
Change the code so that all variables are declared using let or const. Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant. Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices. Do not change the strings assigned to the variables.

const FCC = "freeCodeCamp";
let fact = "is cool!"; 
fact = "is awesome!";
console.log(FCC, fact); */

Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20.

Change the 0 so the difference is 12.

Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.

Change the 0 so that the quotient is equal to 2.

Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.

let myVar = 87;
myVar++; */

/* 16.
Change the code to use the -- operator on myVar.

let myVar = 11;
myVar--; */

Create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. 5.7).

const myDecimal = 99.9; */

Change the 0.0 so that product will equal 5.0.

/* 19.
Change the 0.0 so that quotient will equal to 2.2.

const quotient = 4.4 / 2.0; */

/* 20.
Set remainder equal to the remainder of 11 divided by 3 using the remainder (%) operator.

const remainder = 11 % 3; */

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator.

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator.

c *= 10; */

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator.

c /= 11; */

/* 25.
Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:

const myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; */

/* 26.
Change the provided string to a string with single quotes at the beginning and end and no escape characters.

Right now, the <a> tag in the string uses double quotes everywhere. You will need to change the outer quotes to single quotes so you can remove the escape characters.

const myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>'; */

/* 27.
Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences.

FirstLine
    \SecondLine
ThirdLine

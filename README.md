## Problem Solutions Repository

This repository is dedicated to storing the solutions to coding problems from platforms like CodeWars and LeetCode. It serves as a central location to track your progress and showcase your problem-solving skills.

### Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a specific problem or category of problems. Within each folder, you can find the following:

- **Problem Statement**: A file named `problem.md` or `README.md` containing the description of the problem, including any provided examples and constraints.

- **Solution**: A file named `solution.<ext>`, where `<ext>` represents the file extension corresponding to the programming language used for the solution (e.g., `.js` for JavaScript, `.py` for Python). This file contains your implementation of the solution.

- **Test Cases**: A folder named `testcases` or `tests` containing input and expected output files or a test suite specific to the problem.

### Usage

To use this repository effectively, follow these guidelines:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the corresponding problem folder and read the `problem.md` or `README.md` file to understand the problem requirements and constraints.

3. Implement your solution in the appropriate programming language and save it as `solution.<ext>`.

4. Optionally, create test cases in the `testcases` or `tests` folder to validate your solution. Ensure that the provided test cases cover various scenarios and edge cases.

5. Commit and push your changes to the repository, including both the solution code and any test cases.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add solution for <problem-name>"
git push origin main
```

### Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have a new solution or want to improve an existing one, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

2. Create a new branch for your changes.

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

3. Make your modifications and commit them with descriptive messages.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add solution for <problem-name>"
```

4. Push your changes to your forked repository.

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

5. Open a pull request from your branch to the main repository and provide a detailed description of your changes.

Once your pull request is reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main repository.

### Disclaimer

Please note that the solutions provided in this repository are for educational and personal use. They are meant to showcase different approaches and techniques for solving coding problems. The solutions may not always be the most optimal or efficient, and there can be multiple valid solutions. It is encouraged to understand and explore alternative solutions as well.
